The climb straight out of (Plaza Nueva?) came as a shock with our route sending us up some 20% alleys on el Camindo de Santiago (northern route). Then the wet set in, and when the dark did too we pulled up short for the night beside a council water pumping station in some hills (hoping this won’t offend anyone (Basques).
